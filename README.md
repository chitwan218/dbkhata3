concept 
sale (credit) = you will receive (positive)

purchase (credit) = you have to pay (negative)

receipt (cash/bank) = reduces what they owe

payment (cash/bank) = reduces what you owe

income and expense = excluded completely

Confirmed Matching Logic

Type	Mode	Effect
Sale	Credit	➕ Receivable
Purchase	Credit	➖ Payable
Receipt	Cash/Bank	➖ What they owe
Payment	Cash/Bank	➖ What you owe
Income	(ignored)	❌
Expense	(ignored)	❌
Lets start dbkhata3

Cash in/Cash out logic
Cash In = receipt, income
cash In = sale in cash/bank (but not for credit)
Cash Out = payment, expense
Cash out = Purchase in cash/bank (but not for credit)
